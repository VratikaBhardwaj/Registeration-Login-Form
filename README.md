# Registeration-Login-Form
Part 1: Frontend
A simple HTML form with the following fields:
1. Username (input field)
2. Email (input field)
3. Password (input field)
4. Confirm Password (input field)
5. Submit button
   
Validate the form inputs using PHP. The username, email, and password fields are not empty. The email field should be a valid email format, and the password and confirm password fields should match.

Part 2: Backend
A PHP script to process the form data submiMed by the user.
1. Perform server-side valida=on to ensure all fields are filled out correctly and meet the requirements (e.g., non-empty fields, valid email, matching passwords).
2. If the valida=on fails, display appropriate error messages on the frontend, indica=ng what went wrong.
3. If the valida=on passes, store the user's informa=on (username, email, and password) securely in a MySQL database table.

Other Points:
1. Implement password hashing when storing the password in the database.
2. Add a "Login" funconality to the project, allowing registered users to log in with their creden=als and display a simple dashboard page aXer successful login.
